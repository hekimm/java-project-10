# Armstrong Number Checker

A Java console application that checks if a number is an Armstrong number. Users are asked to input a number and its digit count. The program then determines if the sum of the digits, each raised to the power of the digit count, matches the original number. This might be helpful for those just starting to explore loops, conditionals, and basic arithmetic operations in Java.

## Project Description

This program introduces the concept of Armstrong numbers and provides a practical example of how to implement arithmetic calculations and loops in Java. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Features

- User input for number and its digit count.
- Calculation to determine if the number is an Armstrong number.
- Displays whether the entered number qualifies as an Armstrong number.

## How to Run

Ensure Java is installed on your computer and follow these steps to run the application:

1. Download the `JavaApplication32.java` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac JavaApplication32.java`.
5. Run the compiled Java program with: `java JavaApplication32`.
6. Follow the on-screen prompts to input a number and its digit count.
